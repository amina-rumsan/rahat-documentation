# Release 2.11.0
Welcome to the Rahat May Release. The major upgrade in Rahat this month is the deployment of the Crowdfunding tool along with some minor bug fixes. 
# Rahat Crowdfunding platform 
Rahat Crowdfunding platform is a web-based blockchain-supported platform for the beneficiaries to organize an online fundraising campaign to collect the amount. With the help of Rahat crowdfunding platform, one can organize a campaign for needy people and collect the fund. On the other hand, people can donate amounts to fundraising campaigns. 

One of the best things about the Rahat crowdfunding platform is it is an independent platform where anyone can create their fundraising account and create campaigns. The fundraiser does not have to be Rahat's agency.

Rahat crowdfunding platform has two types of users. 
Fundraiser who will organize the fundraising campaign 
Donor who will donate funds to the campaign 
### Fundraiser 
It is necessary for a fundraise to create an account on the platform to organize the campaign. So, the first step to becoming a Rahat fundraiser is to **Sign up using email**. Then, the user will **Sign in** to the account using the registered email address and **One-Time Password** sent to the email as a verification process. 

After login into the website, the fundraiser can create a Campaign by going to **My fundraiser.**
