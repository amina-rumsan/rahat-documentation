# Welcome 

We are a community of contributors - developers, volunteers, researchers and the humanitarian sector including employees of Rumsan. We create an environment where our community can effectively explore, create innovative and open aid distribution technology services which are inclusive, accountable and accessible for everyone.

Together, we create an environment where innovation thrives, developing open and inclusive aid distribution technology that's accountable and accessible to all. This document serves as a comprehensive collection of all Rahat documentation, with a dynamic structure that adapts and evolves.

Join our [community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/rahataid/discussions) on GitHub and help shape the future of Rahat! Your contributions will not only benefit the project but also empower marginalised communities by improving access to aid distribution technology for the community.
