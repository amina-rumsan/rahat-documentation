# Partners and Investors 

The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), through its Innovation Fund, invested in a new cohort of startups developing open-source, blockchain-based solutions [received equity-free investment of $100,000](https://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/broadcast/updates/rahat-tokenized-aid-distribution-platform-support-vulnerable-communities) and year-long mentorship — including Rahat, a blockchain startup in Nepal. As part of the UNICEF Innovation Fund’s portfolio, Rahat joins a community of problem solvers developing open source solutions further with frontier technology like blockchain to address inequities children face.
