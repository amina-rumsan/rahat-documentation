# Project Charter

Open Source community has given many fine solutions. We, Rumsan team, are direct beneficiary of a lot of these software. We are big believers of paying it forward. Rahat is one of our few software we have developed that we want to bring it open source community. We believe, if we can save some software cost for the aid agencies that savings will flow to the aid beneficiaries.
